      <h4>About Me</h4>
      <p> I am a Mother, Daughter, Nurse, Midwife and Operational Research Consultant. In my spare time I am an 
        <a href="https://www.arbonne.com/gb/en/arb/jeanmcleod/cart?shareId=8812855119399">Arbonne Consultant</a> 
        and provide educational opportunities for hard to reach groups. 
        </p>

       <p> The knowledge I have gained through this Bootcamp to date has given me the confidence to support a 
         small group of sixth formers who are interested in learning to code. </p>
        <p> Becoming a fully fledged Full-Stack coder will give the skills to code raspberry Pi and build tech for fun
       and improve the user experience and patient pathways through their healthcare journey.</p>

     <h4><p>Wednesday 29 December 2021 @ 17:35.</p></h4>
      <p> I have been watching FLEXBox tutorial by Brad 2016. Taken me 6 hours (in between meals LoL!!) to work through 20 minutes.
        Writing a ReadMe file as I go and storing it on Git Desktop which needs to update when I sign out. I hope it does not loose it.
        Really good video at getting me to unpick the code.
        Found that the box background colour was not being picked up and discovered it was a missing colon. Urghhh!!</p>
        
        <h4><p>Wednesday 13 April 2022 @ 15:45.</p></h4>
        <p> Our recent group project was to create an app using Frontend tools and APIs.  The game we created was a, timed, question 
          and answer game where the player would choose from 4 possible answers.</p>
